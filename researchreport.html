        <section id="abstract">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>RMC Inc. seeks to determine the optimal blending process for two of their chemical products: a fuel additive and a solvent base. The goal is to maximize total profit while considering the constraints posed by the availability of raw materials. Using a linear programming model, this report identifies the ideal blending process to optimize production while maximizing profit.</p>

        <section id="objective">
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>RMC Inc. aims to determine the optimal production quantities for fuel additive and solvent base to maximize profit while adhering to material constraints.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="data">
            <h2>Data Discussion</h2>
            <p>Fuel additive yields $40 per ton, while the solvent base provides $30 per ton. Each product requires different raw materials with specific constraints. The objective is to allocate resources efficiently to maximize profit.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>A linear programming model was employed to determine optimal production levels while considering material constraints. The objective function is represented as:</p>
            <pre>Maximize Profit = 40X + 30Y</pre>
            <p>Subject to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2/5X + 1/2Y ≤ 20 (Material 1)</li>
                <li>1/5Y ≤ 5 (Material 2)</li>
                <li>3/5X + 3/10Y ≤ 21 (Material 3)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="results">
            <h2>Analysis Results</h2>
            <p>The optimal production levels were determined to be 25 tons of fuel additive and 20 tons of solvent base, yielding a total profit of $1,600. Material 1 and 3 were fully utilized, while Material 2 was used at 80% capacity.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="suggestions">
            <h2>Suggestions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase product prices to $60 per ton for fuel additive and $50 per ton for solvent base to boost profit.</li>
                <li>Invest in more raw materials, particularly Material 1 and 3, to expand production capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="summary">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>RMC Inc. should adjust pricing strategies and expand resource acquisition to enhance profitability. This approach will ensure competitiveness and maximize resource utilization.</p>
